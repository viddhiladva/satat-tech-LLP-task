This is a single-page application that contains student JSON data in the state. Fields: Student Name, Email, Phone, Marks, Pass/Fail Using this state json data, show a student information list page with pagination and a second page with the Create/Edit Student Form, which will add or edit in this same state json data.
To run this project,

--> npm i 
-->npm run dev 

Here, I used React for the form and some validation concepts.For storing data, I used a local storage with JASON.and for styling purposes, Tailwind CSS is used.
Here, I provide two pages , one of which is for existing student data (a kind of dashboard). and another for form-filling and adding student data.
